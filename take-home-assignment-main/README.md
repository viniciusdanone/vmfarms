# This is a candidate assessment assignment from stack.io

# Guideline

Welcome to our `Take Home Assingment`. We are going to provide you with a sequence of tasks to be executed:
* [Task 1](dockerize): Dockerize a simple golang webserver; You do not need to modify or write any golang code. You do not need to be familiar with the golang language either, just with how to manipulate and use an already written golang app.
* [Task 2](kubernetes): Deploy that docker image to your local k8s cluster following the given spec
* [Task 3](terraform): Create a terraform module
* [Task 4](linux): Write down a shell script for further automation
